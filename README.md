## About this Event
Pie & AI is a series of DeepLearning.AI meetups independently hosted by community groups. This event is hosted by Hafiz Muhammad Attaullah. Special thanks to their support!

Event Agenda & Speakers:

We gives an overview of Machine Learning and delves deep into the pipeline used - right from fetching the data, the tools and frameworks used to creating models, gaining insights and telling a story.
